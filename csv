## 📊 Introduction to CSV Data (OpenOffice & Excel)

### ✅ **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

* Recognize key features of CSV data.
* Import CSV data into a spreadsheet (OpenOffice or Excel).
* Create a simple population chart using the data.

---

### 🗂️ **Steps (Common for Both Tools)**

#### **Step 1: Open Terminal & Navigate**

```bash
cd big-data-2/csv
```

#### **Step 2: View CSV File**

```bash
ls
more census.csv
```

* The first row = header
* Remaining rows = data
* Entries are **comma-separated**

---

### 🧾 **OpenOffice Instructions**

#### Step 3: Launch OpenOffice Spreadsheet

* Download from [OpenOffice.org](https://www.openoffice.org/)
* Open → **Spreadsheet**

#### Step 4: Import CSV

* `File` → `Open` → Select `census.csv`
* In **Text Import dialog**: Choose **Comma** as separator → Click **OK**

#### Step 5: Check CSV Size

* Scroll to bottom → Total: **3194 rows**
* Note: Spreadsheets aren’t suitable for **millions of rows** → Use **Big Data tools** like **Hadoop**

#### Step 6: Plot Population Chart (Alabama)

* Select **row 2**, columns **J to O** (years 2010–2015)
* Click **Chart** → Click **Finish**
* Chart appears in spreadsheet

---

### 📈 **Microsoft Excel Instructions**

#### Step 3: Create New Workbook → Import CSV

* `Data` → `From Text/CSV` → Select `census.csv`
* In import dialog: **Delimiter = Comma** → Click **Load**

#### Step 4: Check CSV Size

* Scroll down → Confirm **3194 rows**

#### Step 5: Create Population Chart (Alabama)

* Select **row 2**, columns **J to O**
* `Insert` → `Recommended Charts` → Choose first chart → Click **OK**

---

### 💡 Notes

* **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a simple and widely-used format.
* Ideal for small to medium-sized datasets.
* Use **Big Data systems** (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) for large datasets beyond spreadsheet capabilities.

Here's a **summary of the video titled "Exploring the Relational Data Model of CSV Files"** from the *Big Data Modeling and Management Systems* course (Module 2) on Coursera:

---

### 📄 **Objective**

* To explore how **CSV files** align with the **relational data model** using Excel.
* Perform **filtering**, **aggregation**, and **basic statistical operations** on census data.

---

### 🧰 **Steps Performed**

1. **Importing CSV Data into Excel**

   * Open Excel → Click *Blank Workbook*.
   * Go to *Data* tab → Click *From Text/CSV*.
   * Select the `"Census CSV"` file and click *Load*.

2. **Applying Filters**

   * Use dropdown arrows at the top of columns.
   * Example:

     * **Filter by state** → Keep only California.
     * **Filter by population** → Use “Greater than 1,000,000” to see counties with large populations.
   * Notice: A **summary row** (e.g., for all of California) may be included.

3. **Clearing Filters**

   * Go to *Data* tab → Click *Clear* to remove all applied filters.

---

### 📊 **Performing Statistical Operations**

4. **Create New Sheet**

   * Add and rename a new sheet (e.g., to `"Stats"`).

5. **Calculate Average**

   * Use Excel formula:
     `=AVERAGE(SheetName!H5:H13)`
     (Calculates average population of selected counties)

6. **Calculate Sum**

   * Use Excel formula:
     `=SUM(SheetName!H16:H25)`
     (Sums population values for selected counties)

---

### 🔁 **Key Takeaways**

* CSV files can be viewed as **relational tables** with rows (records) and columns (attributes).
* Excel enables relational-style **queries**, **filters**, and **aggregations**.
* Helps understand **basic relational operations** without writing SQL.
